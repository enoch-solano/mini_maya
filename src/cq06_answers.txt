Question 1) Given a mesh with all of its half-edges created but none of its SYM pointers set, what is the minimum information needed to determine which half-edge should be the SYM of some other half-edge?

	The minimum information needed to determine which half-edge should be the SYM of some other half-edge is the vertex information. That is, the vertex each edge points to.

Question 2) Which function in the Drawable class determines the primitives (i.e. triangles, lines, or points) with which a given mesh will be drawn? What does Drawable::elemCount return, and where is this value used?

	Drawable::drawMode() determines the primitives with which a mesh will be drawn. Drawable::elemCount() returns the number of indices stored in bufIdx. This value is used in the ShaderProgram's draw() function.
